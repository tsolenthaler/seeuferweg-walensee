# Use-Case

# Prompt

```
Create a web app called “seeuferweg-walensee.”
This web app allows visitors to see all important places (POIs), routes (tours), events, and offers/products around Lake Walen on a map.
These can also be listed as a list or tiles and filtered by name, type, category, opening hours, date, and price.
These items can be sorted by name, location, date, or price.
Each item can be saved as a favorites list, and this list can be shared with others.
The web app is available in German and English.
The design should be the same as https://seeuferweg-walensee.dev.cms.tso.ch/de/map.html. 
The content should be taken from https://opendata.ost.contentdesk.io/api/products.json and https://opendata.visitgl.contentdesk.io/api/products.json.

The result should be publishable as GitHub Pages.
